## Presentation
My presentation was focused on the "feelings" of the robot. 
In the movie the main hero tells the robot: 
>-"You don't feel fear, you don't have dreams, even a dog has dreams. Can you write a symphone? Can you take a canvas a make a masterpiece of it?" 

On what the robot asks back: 
>-"Can you?"

## Final project idea
I would like to re-create a theater piece using a robot that will be one of the actors. 
The robot will have an audio device that has programmed phrases which need to be told at a specific moment
