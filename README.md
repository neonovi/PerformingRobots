# PerformingRobots


## Presentation
My presentation was focused on the "feelings" of the robot. 
In the movie the main hero tells the robot: 
>-"You don't feel fear, you don't have dreams, even a dog has dreams. Can you write a symphone? Can you take a canvas a make a masterpiece of it?" 

On what the robot asks back: 
>-"Can you?"

## Final project idea
I would like to re-create a theater piece using a robot that will be one of the actors. 
The robot will have an audio device that has programmed phrases which need to be told at a specific moment 




## Final Project Documentation #1

### Praggya and I met up to divide the work. She had interest in the the robot that is going to be assembled by the other robot. Then I've taken the "robotic arm" task to do. I had a cardboard version before I started on the wooden one. The wooden version was made to make it more stable and strong over the cardboard version. The wooden version can be seen below.

### The robot will also be attached to a DC motor at the base so it can rotate. The lifting mechanism is made like the lifting mechanism of the Jellyfish but the opposite way. It is pulling down such that the plank raises (details can be seen in the video) At the tip of the plank I've added two servos (tested them) and they will be part of the future claw. All of the controls will be via bluetooth. The wires are soldered and waiting there for the bluetooth. I have connected an external power supply, because without it the 240RPM motor didn't have enought torque to lift the plank.
