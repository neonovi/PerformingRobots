# PerformingRobots
Midterm project #1

Goals for the break:

1: Finish the base in such way that all of the wires are soldered and look fine.

2: fix the bug when both sensors touch the line

3: Draw a track for the robot which will be consistent

4: Draw an extra track (just in case)

5: Help other teammates once done with all of the above
